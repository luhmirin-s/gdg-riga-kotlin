/**
 * Write a program to show that the 13th day of the month
 * falls more often on a Friday than any other day of the
 * week. The 1st of January 1973 was a Monday.
 * You should aim at producing the clearest possible
 * program, not the fastest.
 *
 * A leap year is defined as one that is divisible by 4,
 * but is not otherwise divisible by 100 unless it is
 * also divisible by 400.
 *
 * For example, 2001 is a typical common year and 1996
 * is a typical leap year, whereas 1900 is an atypical
 * common year and 2000 is an atypical leap year.
